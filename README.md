# data-cleaning-sql1
In this portfolio project involving a dataset containing housing details, I conducted a thorough data cleaning process to enhance its quality and structure.
The project began with data retrieval, followed by standardizing date formats and addressing null values to ensure data consistency.
I then separated composite address and owner information into distinct columns, improving data organization.
Additionally, I standardized categorical values, such as converting 'Y' to 'Yes' and 'N' to 'No,' using SQL's CASE statement.
To eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity, I identified and removed duplicate records based on specific criteria. 
Finally, I streamlined the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, making it more suitable for future analysis and reporting tasks.
